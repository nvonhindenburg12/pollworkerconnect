          Poll Worker Connect was founded by Oliver and Nick, high school students who saw the importance of poll workers in the United States. 52% of voting locations struggled to get poll workers in 2020. With less workers, fewer polling centers can operate, disincentivizing voters as they must travel farther and wait longer to vote. <br> <br>We decided to tackle this issue by creating Poll Worker Connect, which aims to streamline the process of becoming a poll worker, avoiding too many steps, broken links, or outdated designs. We hope this website can help people of all ages, especially those in high school or college. By volunteering, students ensure the integrity of our democracy and develop the knowledge necessary to ensure that future generations can continue this sacred American tradition, and they receive money or service hours as an added bonus!
